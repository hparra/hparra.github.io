# vs code

YATE, though some may be offended by that.
my other editor identifies as an operating system.
offensive jokes aside, vs code is wonderful.
it's been one of my primary tools for many years now.
i'm complaning because i like it.

## workspaces

i'm experimenting with these, but I've found some edge cases.
i can't seem to get my home folder in a workspace together with other folders that are descendants of my home folder.
vs code bugs out and folders and files disappear from explorer.

## extensions

i really wish i could turn this on/off from a config file.
