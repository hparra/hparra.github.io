# Search and Recovery

## Knowledge Review - Part 1

A **recreational search and recovery diver**:
- recovers only small to medium size objects
- profit or employment is not primary goal

Six **potential hazards of search and recovery diving** include:
- sharp objects and debris
- entanglement
- low visibility
- currents
- falling objects
- boat traffic

Five general **steps in planning a search and recovery dive** are:
- define the dive objective
- collect and analyze all available information
- select a diving mode: snorkel or scuba
- choose a dive buddy or team
- briefing everyone involved

Use an **expanded square search pattern** or a **U search patter** when:
- you only have a compass
- varied topographies
- large search areas
- wallet-sized objects or larger

Use a **circular rope search pattern** when:
- item is small in a small area
- item is larger in current or surge
- bottom is flat and free of obstructions
- you have a line reel

Execute a **circular roper search pattern** by:
- anchor diver anchoring line at center of search area
- search diver takes taut line and swims in circle
- after revolution release more line

You should **never use your BCD for lifting objects** because it could result in a runaway ascent.

**The use of a lift bag becomes mandatory with anything over 10 pounds.**

Three reasons why **commercially-made lift bags should be used for recovering underwater objects**:
- made from heavy duty material designed for lifting
- have dump valve systems
- have convenient rigging

Procedure for **controlling, rigging, and lifting an object using a lift bag**:
- secure a marker buoy and the lift bag to the object
- check rigging
- inflate the bag slowly in small bursts, pulling up between bursts, until it hovers
- swim the bag and object horizontally (if necessary)
- begin swimming up slowly with the bag
- escort the bag venting to control ascent, or allow it to ascend independently

**Alternate second stage or an accessory inflater are the only air sources you should use for filling a lift bag.**

## Knowledge Review - Part 2

Procedure for a **jackstay search pattern**:
- use when searching for small object in large, relatively flat area with moderate current
- establish baseline along search area
- both divers start at edge of search area at one end of base line
- Diver 1 swims search rope out perpendicular to baseline, searching
- Diver 2 remains in place anchoring other end
- Diver 1 reaches end of line and pulls it tight, then takes the end and swims toward unsearched area a short distance based on visibility and required overlap
- Diver 1 anchors the end and swims back along the search rope back to Diver 2, searching
- reunited, both divers move forward until search rope is perpendicular with baseline
- repeat

Procedure for **snorkeler led search pattern**:
- use with one or more divers over a relatively large pattern looking for a relatively large object
- establish search area with anchored buoys or landmarks at four corners
- snorkeler swims the pattern
- divers swim in a V pattern with leader holding line

Procedure for **semicircular search pattern**:
- use over bottoms that are flat and obstruction free and in current you can swim against
- select a compass heading that takes search in straight line through search area
- diver 1 holds search line
- diver 2 swims with other end along the determined compass heading until it's taut
- if divers cannot see each other, then make search line shorter
- diver 2 becomes anchor diver
- diver 1 becomes search diver
- search diver swims half circle until realigning with the heading
- anchor diver watches and signals when search diver reaches that point
- divers switch roles
- when they reach end of search area then searching diver makes full circle, switching direction
- if object is not found, then establish another line overlapping original one

Procedure for **shore walk search pattern**:
- use when searching a large area along shore, with one or many divers, and a tender on shore
- tender holds search line and walks along shore
- divers start at deepest point away from shore
- divers hold line taut while swimming and search perpendicular from shore
- when divers they reach end of search area, tender signals and takes up line
- divers reverse direction
- repeat until at shallow depth

**Bottom topography and water movement can affect a search** by:
- dictating what search techniques you can use due to obstacles or current
- influencing whether water motion can carry away object or bury it

**Professional search and recovery differs from recreational** in that:
- it is for profit and/or employment
- requires professional and ongoing training
- may use sophisticated equipment
- may be subject to labor/work regulations

**Pinpoint a fix on a submerged object while at the surface over it** by:
- staying where you are
- selecting two inline permanent landmarks on shore
- rotating between 60 and 120 degrees
- selecting another two inline landmarks
- documenting information

**Relocate an object using a known fix** by:
- swimming to general area
- align with one set of landmarks
- swim along line until other set of fixes align
- descend and search

Three **commonly used knots for search and recovery** are:
- bowline: attaching rigging to lift bag and object
- sheet bend: joining two lines together
- two half-hitches: tie line around an object

**Prepare for tying knots underwater** by:
- learning to tie the knot
- practicing tying knots with gloves
- practicing tying knots with gloves and with eyes closed
