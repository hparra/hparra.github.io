# Parra

**Parra** is my last name. My father's paternal last name to be exact.

In Spanish, a *parra* is a grapevine. It is also a Sephardic last name.

It is important to note its pronunciation - think of a lion's paw: pAHrra. Try rolling the R's too. Rawr.
But be forewarned: Do not pronounce it *perra*. In Spanish "perra" means "bitch", and I'm nobody's bitch.
Remember that. HGPA
