Multi-Programming
=================

Concurrency and Parallelism.

## tl;dr

concurrency - dealing with many things at once
parallelism - doing many things at once

Threads:
- 1:1 -- (kernel-level) each user thread corresponds to a kernel thread
- N:1 (user-level) all user threads correspond to a single kernel thread
- M:N (hybrid)

## IMPLEMENATIONS

### C++

TODO

### Java

Every java object has its own lock

```java
new Thread(() -> {
  //
}).start();
```

### Go

Lighter weight than threads.
Goroutines get multiplexed onto OS threads as needed.

Channels are like unix pipes but they have names and types.

`select` allows you to listen to channels. Like a switch statement.

### Javascript
