regex -- Regular Expressions
============================

Every programmer should learn to use these,
but approach them with the respect of learning another programming language,
because that's really what they are.
Get a good book.

There are two popular regex styles:
- Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE)
- POSIX

PCREs in some form are used natively in some languages, e.g.:
- javascript
- python
- java

Beware that even PCREs amongst languages have slight feature differences and quirks:
- what `.` actually matches
- multiple-line support
- back references
- advanced features

## Review

PCRE basics:
- Characters or Tokens
  - any literal (with some exceptions)
  - escape special characters or rules when you want to use literally
  - Specials:
    - `.` any character
    - `^` beginning of line
    - `$` end of line
- Sets are groups (or ranges) of characters
  - `[ ]` positive set
  - `[^ ]` negative set
  - Use `-` in a set to denote range between characters
  - character classes are sugar for sets:
    - `\d` equivalent to `[0-9]`
    - `\w` equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`
    - `\s` equivalent to `[ \t\r\n\f]`
- Groups
  - Use these to group or capture
  - `()` capturing group
  - `(?:)` non-capturing group
  - `(?P<var>)` named capturing group (named _var_)
- Alternation (Boolean or) `|`
  - Separate items, sets or unions
- Quanifiers
  - `{M}` exactly M times
  - `{M,}` mininum M times
  - `{M,N}` minimum M maximum N times
  - "greedy quantifiers" are just sugar:
    - `*` equivalent to `{0,}`
    - `+` equivalent to `{1,}`
    - `?` equivalent to `{0,1}`
- Assertions
  - Lookahead
    - `x(?=y)` match x only if it is followed by y
    - `x(?!y)` match x only if it is not followed by y
  - Lookbehind
    - `(?<=y)x` match x only if it follows y
    - `(?<!y)x` match x only if it does not follow y

## Implementations

- JavaScript is missing quite a few PCRE features:
  - lookbehind assertions (maybe in future)
  - named groups
  - (and more)

## Notes on Bash

Bash globbing (filename expansions) look similar to regex but are not.
They are still very useful:
- `?` single character wildcard
- `*` multi character wildcard
- `[ ]` bracket expression
- `[^ ]` negated bracket expression
- `[-]` options range
  - `^` negate range (place inside bracket)
