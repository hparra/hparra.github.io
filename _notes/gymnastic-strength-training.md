gymnastics strength training (GST)
==================================

I've finished the [Gymnastics Bodies](https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/training/) Fundamentals course. I highly recommend it.

I'm currently working on the first Foundations class, but I don't like it as much as the Fundamentals approach and therefore cannot recommend it.

## Fundamentals

"Daily Stretch":
- wrists
  - palms, fingers forward
  - palms, fingers backwards
  - backs, finger forwards
  - backs, fingers backwards
- seal + cat (x2)
- capsule
- shoulder extension + hip swivel
- straddle
  - center
  - left
  - right
- butterfly
- pike
- shoulder bridge
- calf stretch
