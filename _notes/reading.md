## Tips

First take notes on a source, e.g. book, paper, blog post
Once you've done for a few sources then you refactor these to produce notes on a subject.

Study the Table of Contents (TOC):
- Does this book address your needs?
- What is critical and what is unnecessary?
- Use the TOC as the base outline for your notes
  - Copy and "fill-in"
