## Amazon's Leadership Principles

The following is my abridgment of Amazon's "Leadership Principles".

**Leaders**:
- start with the customer and work backwards (_Customer Obsession_)
- are owners (_Ownership_)
- _Invent and Simplify_
- use judgement and instinct to understand when they are right or wrong (_Are Right, A Lot_)
- continue to _Learn and Be Curious_
- _Hire and Develop the Best_
- _Insist on the Highest Standards_
- _Think Big_
- prefer calculated risks to inaction (_Bias for Action_)
- accomplish more with less (_Frugality_)
- _Earn Trust_
- operate at any and all levels (_Dive Deep_)
- challenge decisions when they disagree, and do not compromise for comfort (_Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit_)
- _Deliver Results_
