As a Man Thinketh (1903)
========================

This book changed my life.

Originally by [James Allen][1], I was introduced to this by book by [Earl Nightingale][2], who recited portions of it on his radio program. The power of Allen's words combined with the delivery by Nightingale was life-altering.

You can [download "As a Man Thinketh"][3] in various formats from Project Gutenberg.

You can find uploads of Nightingale's audio edit on YouTube.

Sometime I would like to explain when and how this happened, but until then I leave you with this:

> **A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his life.** And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against circumstances, but begins to _use_ them as aids to his more rapid progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself.
