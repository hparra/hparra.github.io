now -- What Iâ€™m Doing Now
=========================

## 2017 -- Quarter 3

The theme this quarter will be _preparedness_. How can I always be prepared, even for the things I never planned for? My focus concerns the discipline and metrics feedback loop -- discipline to commit to dedicated times to do certain things and measure progress. Seems like something we all should be doing already, but when managing multiple personal projects every 30 minutes count. We eat elephants one bite at a time, but we must remember to take those bites. We're either growing or dying.

This quarter will be a true test my resolve. Stay tuned.
