tips -- some random tips
========================

You really should keep your mouth shut.

If you receive a gift remember to send a note of gratitude.
Even though we may appreciate something, the giver does not necessarily know that.
Best to let them know -- sometimes that's the gift they seek the most.

M.O.B.
