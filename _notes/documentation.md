# Documentation

Documentation is absolutely essential.
Not providing adequate, up-to-date documentation is one of the most irresponsible things we can do as programmers.
Your project, your company, will not survive the test of time without it.

Documentation as Code:
- "Self-Documenting" Code
- Inline Comments
- Documentation Comments
- Markup Documents
- Version Control History
