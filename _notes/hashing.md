Hashing
=======



## Applications

Some popular hashes include:
- md5
- sha1

Some languages have default methods to create an identifying hash for an object:
- Python: [`__hash__(self)`](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__)
- Java: [`hashCode()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode%28%29)

Some languages have default functions to create a hash:
- Ruby: [`hash()`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Object.html#method-i-hash)
- Python: [`hash()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#hash)
