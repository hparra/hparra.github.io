Looks like I will move forward with goliki.
Building it has been a good experience,
even if it's a hack job like its predecessor, gliki.

I now need to configure a github action to build the cli and run it.

```bash
# install deps
go get .

# build and run script
go run main.go
```

Here are examples for Github Workflows to publish to Pages:
https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main/pages.

Doc for Workflows and Building and Testing Go https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-go.

And of course, the Quickstart: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart

By default, the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) only gets the latest commit:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo
uses: actions/checkout@v3
with:
    # Depth of 0 fetches everything
    fetch-depth: 0
    submodules: recursive
```

Looks like this works! [hgpa.tv](https://www.hgpa.tv).
