# email

I don't like email.
I've always thought [Knuth said it best](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html).
Unfortunately, email is still a necessary activity for many,
including myself.

Honestly, it's not all the different from regular mail:
Junk, promotions, and the occasional important thing,
most of which require some action to be taken.
Sometimes the email asks you to check something else that is usually restricted,
e.g. health or financial matters,
so you need to log into the website.

Some common [compose actions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Ccompose-chat%2Cactions):

- Delete it (#)
- Archive it (e)
- Leave it alone (for now)
- Respond (& Archive)

Some common [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en):

- `label:inbox`
- `label:inbox label:unread`
- `from:`
- `subject:`


Delete it:
- Promotional emails

Do I need to take a critical action, e.g. respond, etc.
Yes?
Can you do it now?
No?
Because you need to be on a computer?
Because you need privacy?


No?
Is it a promotional email?
Do you care about these?
Yes? Read and delete.
No? Unsubscribe and delete all.
