# Death

Death is one of the few things we can be certain of.
We probably won’t know when or how,
but we know it will happen.

Preparing for death can mean a few different things.
It’s time to get your affairs in order.
If you think about it, it’s a hell of a time to do so.
Some things are common amongst most people,
and there are books and guides dedicated to this sort of thing.

A popular question is:
What would you do today if you knew it were your last day?
Have you thought about this?
Do you have an answer?
Is the idea to make it the most worthwhile day possible?
To make it the happiest day possible?
What does that mean to you?

Do you know where you want to end up?
Do you know how you want to be remembered?

Sometimes, I think of the question:
If you could trade the remainder of your real life,
To live a day of your dream life,
Would you?
What is that dream life like?
Why can’t you live that life now?
Are you striving for it?
Or have you given up on your dreams?
Are you living?
Or are you dying?

When looking back at life,
did it feel monotonously real,
or did it feel like a dream?
Was the dream good or bad?
Maybe death is just finally waking up.
