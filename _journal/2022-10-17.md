# 2022-10-17

I learned about [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) yesterday so I’m testing it now!

One issue on iOS is that two subsequent dashes are being converted into a single longer dash, which we don’t want. Getting the three dashes is a little awkward.

I was successfully able to clone my GitHub repo, make a new markdown file, and push my changes to trigger a new build. This does exactly what I want!

Earlier today I continued building “goliki”. I successfully added a custom ASTTransformer and walked the AST for each document to find Link nodes. I still need to transform the URLs themselves, but I think getting that transformer configured and working was the trickiest part of the code since the docs didn’t really cover how to do this. Sometimes you really do just have to read the code.

TODO: Add really simple transformer example here. I should also figure how to get data out of transformer as well.

Next, I need to abstract collect the YAML front matter for each 
file. See [goldmark-meta](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-meta).

Then, I need to write each final HTML file with file metadata and Markdown HTML. Metadata should specify template to use. I think I will use Go templates for now. See [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template).
