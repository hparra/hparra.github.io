# 2022-10-10

I want to restore my old notes repository as my personal website.

- Convert repo from Gliki to Jekyll
  - Disable .travis.yml (disables Gliki)
  - Install ruby/jekyll
  - Build site as-is with Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/
- Switch repo names
  - https://docs.github.com/en/pages

Uh, I just want to install Jekyll,
but now I have to deal with programming environments, etc.

I spent time googling what the latest version manager was and I was overwhelmed.
I found this article which which was a little clearer than others about suggestions.
I've used rvm and rbenv in the past.
I decedied to use asdf: https://asdf-vm.com/

```bash

# install asdf: https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html
homebrew install asdf 

# Add asdf.sh to your ~/.zshrc
echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc

# reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# install plugin
asdf plugin add ruby

# install ruby
# use same version as Github pages: https://pages.github.com/versions/
asdf install ruby 2.7.4

# set local ruby
asdf local ruby 2.7.4

# reload shell again
source ~/.zshrc

# check version
asdf current

# install github pages deps (jekyll, etc)
gem install github-pages

# reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# create jekyll project in pre-existing markdown dir
jekyll new . --force

# check current example
jekyll serve --incremental
```

- Restore .gitingore
- Disable theme in index.md
- Delete sample in _posts/
- Delete about.md

So now I have a very simple page, index.md.
I changed it to HTML.
Note that you YAML front-matter for Jekyll to process it, else it will stay vanilla HTML.

You don't need to use `_posts`.
They are just a built-in _collection_: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/
Unfortunately, it seems folders do need preceeding underscore.
I will be creating my own collections.

It seems I can't avoid moving all my notes into their own directory.
What I definitely want to avoid is touching each file again to add front matter.
I could either use a plugin, e.g. https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-optional-front-matter,
or I can just programtically add the front matter to the top of each file.
If I use the plugin I want to be able to restrict behavior to that specific collection.
