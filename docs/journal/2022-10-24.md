Time continues to run out.

I've been researching file I/O in golang, and noticed that Go 1.16 introduced a new module to do things like traverse FS directories, but I'm using 1.15.

## Managing Multiple Go Installations

You can manage [multiple go installations](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install) using `go` itself.
You just need to make sure things are set up properly.
It is, yeah?

```bash
# check your current version of go
# $ go version go1.15.2 darwin/amd64
go version

# check where this go is
# $ /usr/local/go/bin/go
which go

# check that your go env variables are all set
# $ GOBIN=""
# $ GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
# $ GOPATH="/Users/hgpa/go"
go env

# install the latest version
# NOTE: versions >  1.15 use `go install` instead   
go get golang.org/dl/go1.19.2
```

Uh, what were those for again?

`GOROOT` is where Go SDK is installed.

`GOPATH` is the root of your Go workspace.
In the past you had to develop your go app in this path.

`GOBIN` is where binary you install live.

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc

# configure golang
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
export GOBIN="$GOPATH/bin"
export PATH="$GOPATH:$GOBIN:$PATH"
alias go="go1.19.2"
```

OK. Now to get back to what I was doing...


## Reading a Directory in Go

I want to read all the files of a certain type in a directory and all of it's subdirectories.
This is meant to replace the git Commit Tree I am currently traversing.

It seems I was mistakened and both filepath and io/fs have a Walk function:
- filepath: https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath@go1.19.2#WalkDir
- io/fs: https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs@go1.19.2#WalkDir

Oh wait. Nevermind. VS Code doesn't recognize 1.19...

How to Write Go Code (with GOPATH).
https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code.
Older versions of Go required your code to exist under GOPATH.
It does explains a little about GOPATH and GOBIN.
It references the best reference: `go help gopath`.

> The Go path is used to resolve import statements.
> The GOPATH environment variable lists places to look for Go code.
> 
> When using modules, GOPATH is no longer used for resolving imports.
> However, it is still used to store downloaded source code (in GOPATH/pkg/mod)
> and compiled commands (in GOPATH/bin).
